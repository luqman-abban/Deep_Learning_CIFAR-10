# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

**Project Overview**

This project is dedicated to developing and evaluating a deep-learning model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known research dataset used to benchmark machine learning algorithms in the field of image recognition. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, covering various objects such as airplanes, cars, birds, etc.

**Data Preprocessing**

The initial phase of the project involves comprehensive data preprocessing to ensure the data is suitable for training a deep learning model. This includes normalization, reshaping of the images, and augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset's diversity and improve the model's generalization ability.

**Model**

The second phase focuses on the model's architecture, training, and evaluation. We experiment with various architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to find the most effective model for classifying images into one of the CIFAR-10 dataset's ten categories.

**Key Features**

Detailed data preprocessing steps to prepare CIFAR-10 images for classification tasks.

Exploration of different model architectures and parameters for optimal performance.

Evaluation metrics to assess the model's accuracy and generalization capability on unseen data.
